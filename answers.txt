Ex. 2
====================

./exploit-2a.py
This exploit triggers the bug in [zookd.c:70]. It sends a request URI that
is longer than the reqpath[2048] buffer, which is filled with the request URI through the unsafe function
http_request_line. This buffer overflow overwrites the return address of the process_client function.

./exploit-2b.py
This exploit triggers the bug in [http.c:282]. It sends a request URI that is longer than the pn[1024] buffer, which is
filled with the request URI through the unsafe C function strcat(). This buffer overflow overwrites the function pointer
*handler, which is at a higher address right above the pn buffer.

Ex. 3
====================
I chose to exploit the bug in [zookd.c:70] which uses the function process_client(int fd).

Through the use of GDB, I was able to find the addresses for stack buffer, base pointer, and return address of the
exploited function. Using these I constructed the stack as follows:

       TOP OF STACK
|stack buffer address + 4 |
|-------------------------| <- &ebp + 4 (return address)
| aaaa                    |
|-------------------------| <- &ebp
| aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...|
|-------------------------|
| injectcode              |
|-------------------------| <- stack buffer address + 4
| /aaa                    |
|-------------------------| <- stack buffer address

The stack buffer is first filled with '/aaa' to mimic a valid request URI. Then it is filled with the inject code,
followed by a padding of 'a's until the length of the entire buffer is equal to return address - stack buffer
address. At this point, the buffer is filled up to the return address. Finally, the buffer is filled with the starting
address of the inject code (stack buffer address + 4), which modifies the content of the return address. When the function
tries to return, it will be directed to the start of the injected code, successfully taking over the program.

The buffer overflow vulnerabilities found in Exercise 1 should all be able exploited in this manner since they all have
the ability to overwrite the content at the return address. Certain modifications to the request URI might be necessary
since some of the exploited buffers are filled with different contents.

Ex. 4
====================
We can overflow values on the stack without any precaution since stack canaries aren't used. As a result, we can use
this type of exploits in all the bugs described in bugs.txt.

Ex. 6
===================
The following changes are made to fix the bugs in bugs.txt:

1. [zookd.c:65] char reqpath[2048] -> static char reqpath[2048]
2. [http.c:120] char value[512] -> static char value[512]
3. [http.c:165] sprintf(envvar, "HTTP_%s", buf) -> snprintf(envvar, sizeof(envvar), "HTTP_%s", buf)
4. [http.c:282] strcat(pn, name) -> strncat(pn, name, 1024)
5. [http.c:344] strcpy(dst, dirname) -> strncpy(dst, dirname, 1024)
