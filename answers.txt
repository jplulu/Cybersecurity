=============

./exploit-2a.py
This exploit triggers the bug in [zookd.c:70]. It sends a request URI that
is longer than the reqpath[2048] buffer, which is filled with the request URI through the unsafe function
http_request_line. This buffer overflow overwrites the return address of the process_client function.

./exploit-2b.py
This exploit triggers the bug in [http.c:282]. It sends a request URI that is longer than the pn[1024] buffer, which is
filled with the request URI through the unsafe C function strcat(). This buffer overflow overwrites the function pointer
*handler, which is at a higher address right above the pn buffer.
